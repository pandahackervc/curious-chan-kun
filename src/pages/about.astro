	<p>
		<strong>Curious Chan Kun</strong> is a thinking space, not a highlight reel. It exists because I
		keep asking why things work the way they do and I need somewhere to put the answers before they
		disappear into half-baked notes and forgotten tabs.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’m interested in mental models, depth psychology, software, systems, and the quiet forces that
		shape how people think and behave. I write to break ideas down, connect dots across domains, and
		see what actually holds up when you look closely. Some posts are structured explorations, some
		are opinions, and some are notes that escaped my PKMS and decided to become blog posts.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is not a productivity cult or a motivation factory. There are no hacks, no overnight
		transformations, and very few definitive conclusions. Just curiosity, careful thinking, and the
		occasional wrong turn. If that sounds useful or at least mildly entertaining, you’re in the
		right place.
